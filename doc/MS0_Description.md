> - There are several user problems that computer science deals with and indeed solves them in an efficient way using a computer and computing equipment.
Daily or weekly scheduling can be considered as one of the most important issue.


# The Problem
During the day, week and the year, people plan a range of events and activities, such as conferences, webinars, parties, social or industrial events and more. These activities cannot be scheduled using papers or handwritten notes; as well; Time limit, fully-crowded day and overload can be considered as the main responsible for encountering managing problems and overlaps between activities and works that the person have to do .As a result, an activity scheduler would be a useful tool for scheduling events.

# Solution

schedulerapi is a cloud-based application that consists of a personal agenda in which work events/activities (tasks to do, appointments, events, meetings, reminders, etc...) can be included; it will also be possible to manage non-working days (weekends,festivals or holidays), so that business events cannot be included during these days.


Once the application is launched, the entities that comprise the system will be revealed, which are as follows:

### An Activity


An agenda will consist of a list of events/activities, each of which will have a title, a description, a start date, an end date, the person associated with the event, and the date of remembrance.
Among its features, we highlight the following:


+ Create/Compose an event.
+ Remove an already-included event.
+ update the event data. 
+ Cancel reminder . 
+ Between two dates, return the personal agenda.
+ Repeat an event, indicating the frequency with which it is repeated and the end date of the repetition; if a copy of the event already exists for that person at that time, that copy of the event will not be inserted at that time.
+ Restore a previously deleted event.
+ The date of remembrance is used to remember an event.



## Vacation Days (Not-working days)

Non-working days, such as weekends, holidays, or vacations, will not be created as personal events; therefore, before inserting or modifying an event, it will be verified that this day is workable.
Those non-working days will be composed of the user associated with them, the days prior to recall, and sets of non-working days (such as specific days of the week, a set of continuous days, or a specific day).
As a result, the following are the functionalities of this entity:

+ Add days to a list of non-working days.
+ Make a calendar of holidays for a user.
+ Add days to a holiday list.
+ Return the number of non-working days in a given year. 
+ Remember vacation day by using reminder.
+ Cancel reminder.
+ modify the reminder.
